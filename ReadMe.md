# What's where


## Taxonomy harmonisation

`"./GIFT/Outputs/Harmonise_Names.R"` is a script for harmonising species names with GIFT.


## Distribution

Maps of the distribution of the CWRs in the preliminary list of CWRs for Europe shared by Louisa (like the one below) are saved in `"./GIFT/Outputs/CWR_World_Maps"`. The code to produce them is in `"./GIFT/Code/GIFT_Sandbox.R"` with a bunch of other experimental code—I still need to clean this up.

## Phylogeny

The phylogenetic trees of CWRs and their next-of-kin crop like the one below are saved in `"./GIFT/Outputs/GIFT_Phylogeny.R"`. The code to produce them is in `"./GIFT/Code/Phylogenetic_Tree.R"` and also contains code to derive a distance matrix from phylogeny objects.
